## Overview

Welcome to the project "Web Stack Debugging #1". In this project, we'll delve into debugging issues related to web server configuration, specifically focusing on resolving why Nginx isn't listening on port 80 in a Ubuntu container.

## Project Details

- **Author:** Sylvain Kalache
- **Project Period:** Mar 4, 2024 6:00 AM to Mar 8, 2024 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review:** An auto review will be launched at the deadline

## Concepts

For this project, we'll explore the concepts of **Network basics** and **Web stack debugging**.

## Tasks

### 0. Nginx likes port 80
- Debug the issue causing Nginx not to listen on port 80 in a Ubuntu container.
- Write a Bash script to configure the server to ensure that Nginx is running and listening on port 80 of all the server's active IPv4 IPs.

### 1. Make it sweet and short (Advanced)
- Using the solution from task #0, create a Bash script that is 5 lines long or less.
- The script must ensure that Nginx is running and listening on port 80.
- Ensure that the `service` command correctly reports that Nginx is not running.
